00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 On a hot spring afternoon in 1963, two men sent by the American CIA snuck into the cafeteria

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 of the Havana Libre Hotel.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Their directive was to retrieve a poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 milkshake of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour up to 18 scoops of

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 ice cream after lunch.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 While exact details of the story are contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze

7
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 to the freezer coils and broke, foiling the CIA's plan and granting Castro many more

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 days to satiate his sweet tooth.

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Ice cream has held a unique role in our world's history, culture, and cravings.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 But where did it come from?

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 The first accounts of cold desserts and iced drinks date back as early as the first century.

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 In civilizations including ancient Rome, Mughal India, and Tang Dynasty China, these icy treats

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 were mainly enjoyed by the royal elites.

14
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 And finding the means to freeze these delicacies wasn always easy Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow Meanwhile ancient Persians built shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique known as sky cooling

15
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 At night, the shallow pools would naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies,

16
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 causing them to dip below the ambient temperature and freeze.

17
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Yet the cream-based treat we know today made a much later debut.

18
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 It was originally inspired by sherbet, or sharbat in Arabic,

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 an icy drink believed to have originated in Persia and subsequently gained popularity in the Middle Ages.

20
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 European travelers brought sharbat recipes home and began creating their own chocolate,

21
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 pine cone, and even eggplant-flavored takes on the refreshment.

22
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 In 1692, Antonio Latini, a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a unique milk-based version, which some historians dub the first ice cream.

23
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 In the 18th century, ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside European settlers to North America.

24
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Yet it was still mainly enjoyed by the upper classes as the process to make it was quite laborious and its main ingredients salt and cream expensive

25
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 George Washington is said to have spent the equivalent of $6,600 in today's dollars on ice cream in one summer alone.

26
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 It was on American soil that the frozen dessert entered its golden age,

27
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 as inventors and entrepreneurs began to engineer ways to bring it to the masses.

28
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 In Philadelphia in 1843, Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream making machine featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier for any home cook.

29
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And storing ice cream was no longer an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman, ice king Frederick Tudor, had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice to households across the globe.

30
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Soon, ice cream was on every street corner.

31
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 In the late 1880s, political turmoil brought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York,

32
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 where many took up jobs as street vendors selling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each Meanwhile American druggists discovered the appeal of combining soda a drink thought to have therapeutic properties at the time

33
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 with ice cream, and a new social spot was born, the soda fountain.

34
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 When the sale of alcohol was banned in 1920,

35
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 many American saloons reinvented themselves as soda fountains,

36
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 and breweries like Anheuser-Busch and Yingling pivoted to producing ice cream.

37
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 At the same time, refrigeration technology was improving rapidly.

38
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer that could house a quart of ice cream.

39
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Even trucks could be equipped with freezers full of frozen treats.

40
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Today, ice cream continues to take on new forms.

41
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And while some of its mysteries may never be solved, one thing is certain.

42
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Our love for ice cream will never thaw.

43
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Did you know that popcorn generates almost 40% of all movie theater profits?

44
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Or that archaeologists have found dumplings in sites dating back a thousand years?
