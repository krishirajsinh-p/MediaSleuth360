## Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Reliance on Speech Quality**: The effectiveness of the system heavily depends on the quality of the input speech.
- **File Size**: There is a 200MB media file size limit due to Streamlit constraints.
- **Language Support**: It may not work **as effectively** for languages other than English.
- **No Memory**: The AI assistant don't have conversational memory because of the limited context window of the LLM model(also to minimize security concerns and resource usage).
